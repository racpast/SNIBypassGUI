// own, and std::atomic<bool> is trivially destructible. The previous version used
// a std::mutex and a std::wstring at namespace scope, and the order in which
// namespace-scope objects in different translation units are destroyed is
// unspecified: a log line written after main() returned could lock a destroyed
// mutex and hand CreateFileW a dangling pointer, which is exactly how a file whose
// name was heap garbage turned up in the working directory.
//
// The specific late log line that did it is gone now — the service stack is
// destroyed before main() returns — but a module whose correctness depends on
// nobody ever logging late is a trap for the next change. This one has no such
// requirement.
