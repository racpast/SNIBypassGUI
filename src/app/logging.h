// Writing is off unless the user turns it on, so LogLine is safe to call
// unconditionally and costs an atomic load when it is off. Nothing on disk is touched
// until a line is actually written — a program nobody asked for a log from leaves no
// directory behind — and the directory is re-created if it goes missing while the
// program runs, which cache cleanup does. Every piece of state this module owns is
// trivially destructible on purpose: a log call must remain safe no matter when it
// happens, including after main() has returned, where a std::mutex or std::wstring
// owned by another translation unit may already have been destroyed.

// call a caller needs; LogEnabled answers without touching the disk.
