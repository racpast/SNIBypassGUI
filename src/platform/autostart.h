// Start-at-logon, expressed through the Task Scheduler API rather than by driving
// schtasks.exe.
//
// The command-line route had to serialize a path into a quoted argument, spawn a
// process, and read its answer back out of a pipe — where the answer arrives in the
// console code page and a non-ASCII install path does not survive the round trip.
// Talking to the scheduler directly moves paths as UTF-16 the whole way, needs no
// quoting, and answers a query in a local call instead of a process launch, which
// matters because the tray menu asks on every open.
namespace Autostart {

// True if the logon task exists AND runs this exact executable. A task pointing at
// another copy reads as disabled, so the answer is always about this install.
bool IsEnabled();

// Register (or replace) the logon task for the current user. Requires the
// administrator rights this program already runs with.
bool Enable();

// Remove the logon task. Succeeds if it was already absent.
bool Disable();
