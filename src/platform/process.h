// so any code that drops a handle and later looks the process back up by PID has

// owning object, and every later question — is it alive, what did it exit with,
// kill it — is answered through that object rather than through a number.

//
//   * Terminating the job kills the process AND every descendant in one kernel
//     operation. nginx forks workers; killing them through a process snapshot
//     means enumerating PIDs and racing their lifetimes, while the job knows its
//     own membership exactly.
//   * The job is configured to kill its members when its last handle closes.
//     Handles close when this program's process object is destroyed — including
//     when it is killed outright — so a crash cannot leave children behind holding
//     ports 80/443/22222. Orphan cleanup stops being an after-the-fact heuristic.

// If the OS refuses to contain the child (an outer job that forbids nesting), the
// child still runs and is still owned; only the two guarantees above are lost, and
// termination falls back to walking the process tree.
