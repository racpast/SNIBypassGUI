// Text baked into the executable's own resources. Used for content that must be
// readable before any file or network access exists — currently the user
// agreement, which gates the first launch.
//
// Documents only, and deliberately so. A resource does not have to be text, but
// reading one as text involves a decision — the byte-order mark is stripped, because
// every document that reaches this function may carry one. That decision is wrong for
// anything that is not text, which is why the updater module reads its own resource
// itself (updater/module.cpp) rather than borrowing this one.
