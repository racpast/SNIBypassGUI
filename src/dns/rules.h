// The redirect rule model: what a rule file says, and what a query name matches.
//
// Rule file syntax (hosts-style, space separated, action first):
//   ACTION domain [domain...]
// ACTION is either an IP (v4 or v6, the redirect target) or the literal "NX"
// (answer NXDOMAIN). Each domain carries an explicit matching prefix:
//   .a.com     apex and every subdomain (suffix match)
//   exact.com  that host only (exact match)
// A line with no ACTION is a parse error and is skipped; there is no implicit
// "bare domain means 127.0.0.1".
//
// Those two forms are exactly the two forms the Name Resolution Policy Table can
// express, and that correspondence is the point: the rule file IS the policy
// table, written once and installed verbatim. A rule set therefore never has to
// disagree with the NRPT about which names are redirected, which is what an
// exclusion syntax would have forced — the NRPT can only carve a name out of an
// enclosing subtree by routing it to a literal DNS server address pinned into the
// registry, and any such address is wrong the moment the machine changes network.
//
// This header is pure logic: no sockets, no registry, no Windows. It is what the
// unit tests exercise, and both consumers — the policy table, which needs the
// namespaces, and the local resolver, which needs the match — read the same
// parsed set.
