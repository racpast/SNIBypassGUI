// The DNS server the policy table points at.
//
// It answers for the names the rule set claims and forwards everything else to
// the machine's real DNS servers, because a policy-table namespace is routed here
// WHOLE: every query type for every name under it, not just the address lookups
// worth redirecting. A resolver that only knew how to answer would therefore turn
// a redirected domain's MX, TXT and SRV records into silence. Forwarding is what
// keeps the redirect confined to what it is meant to change.
//
// UDP and TCP are both served on port 53. TCP is not optional: a forwarded reply
// can come back truncated, and the client's only recourse then is to ask the same
// server again over TCP.
//
// One thread runs one event loop. DNS on loopback is a trickle, and forwarding is
// the only thing here that ever waits on the network — so it is done without
// waiting, by remembering the query and matching the reply when it arrives.
