// DNS redirection, whole: the rules, the policy table that routes names here, and
// the server that answers them.
//
// The two mechanisms are one feature and are owned together, because they are only
// ever correct together. A policy rule pointing at a resolver that is not listening
// breaks every name it covers; a resolver holding rules the policy table has not
// been told about answers nothing. So they are brought up in the order that is safe
// to be interrupted in — resolver first, policy table second — taken down in the
// reverse one, and a hot-reload updates both from the same parse of the file.
//
// The rule set is owned here rather than by the resolver. The resolver needs
// something to match against; which names are redirected, and how many, is a question
// about the file this class read.
//
// Nothing is left behind by a clean stop. What an unclean one leaves is a single
// registry key with a fixed name, which the next start removes before it does
// anything else (see Services::EnforceCleanSlate).
//
// Being up is not a promise about the next second, and this class is what keeps
// watch over its own half of it. A guardian thread holds the invariant above for as
// long as the redirection is meant to be up, waiting — never polling — on the two
// events that can break it:
//
//   * the server's loop ending, which cannot be repaired in place and takes the
//     whole stack down with it;
//   * the policy rule being deleted or altered by something else, which CAN be
//     repaired exactly, because what the table should say is known here.
//
// The difference in treatment is the difference in what the two states cost. A rule
// that has gone missing sends the listed names back to their real addresses: those
// sites break the way they break when this program is not running, which is a
// recoverable, familiar failure. A server that has stopped answering while the rule
// still points at it is the other thing entirely — the queries are accepted by a
// socket nobody reads and never answered, so every listed name hangs until the
// client gives up. That one is not repaired, it is escaped.
