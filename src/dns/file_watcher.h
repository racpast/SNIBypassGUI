// File monitoring with debouncing for DNS rules hot-reload.
//
// Watches a single file and invokes a callback once it has settled (no further
// change for a configurable period), which absorbs editors that write in chunks,
// save-as-rename patterns and other noisy sequences.
//
// Usage:
//   FileWatcher watcher(L"path\\to\\dns_hosts.txt", [] { /* reload */ }, 500);
//   watcher.Start();
//   ...
//   watcher.Stop();
//
// The callback runs on the watcher's own worker thread, never on the thread that
// called Start(), so it must be safe to run concurrently with whatever else the
// owner is doing.

    // Stop monitoring and wait for the worker thread to exit.
    //
    // Every step is guarded by the resource it releases, not by a "running" flag:
    // the thread is joined if it is joinable, the handle closed if it is open. A
    // flag cannot express this, because the worker clears it when it exits on its
    // own — and an early return on that flag would skip the join and leave a
    // joinable std::thread to be destroyed, which terminates the process.
