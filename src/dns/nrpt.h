// The Name Resolution Policy Table: telling Windows which names to resolve here.
//
// The NRPT is the DNS Client service's own routing table. A rule names a set of
// namespaces and the server that answers for them, and the service consults it
// before its ordinary per-adapter servers — so a name it covers is sent where the
// rule says and nowhere else. Every resolver on the machine that goes through the
// system stack obeys it, browsers included.
//
// Two namespace forms exist, and they are exactly the two the rule file offers:
//   ".a.com"   the apex and every subdomain
//   "a.com"    that one host
// There is no exclusion form, and none is emulated here (see dns/rules.h).
//
// This module writes the registry directly rather than shelling out to the
// PowerShell cmdlets that front it. The cmdlets would cost a process launch and a
// module load per call and are absent from some installations; the key layout is
// the actual interface, and it is stable. What is written takes effect within
// about a second, and immediately once the service is told to re-read it.
//
// Everything installed lives under ONE rule with a fixed, well-known key name, so
// removal is exact: there is no enumeration, no matching heuristic, and no way to
// delete a rule the user or their administrator put there. That is what makes
// crash recovery safe — the next start deletes precisely what a previous run could
// have left behind.

namespace Dns {
namespace Nrpt {

// The endpoint as the rule's server field spells it: the bare address at port 53,
// `address:port` otherwise.
//
// The port's omission at 53 is the registry's own convention — its examples are
// bare addresses — and it carries a second, sharper reason here: RuleMatches
// compares this string against what is stored, so if one configuration could be
// spelled two ways, the guardian would read its own write back as a difference and
// rewrite the rule forever. One endpoint, one spelling.
std::wstring ServerField(const BindEndpoint& endpoint);

// Install (replacing any previous copy of) the rule that routes `namespaces` to
// `dnsServer`. An empty list installs nothing and removes the rule instead, since
// a rule with no namespace has nothing to route. Returns false if the registry
// could not be written, in which case nothing has been left half-applied.
bool InstallRule(const std::vector<std::string>& namespaces, const std::wstring& dnsServer);

// Remove the rule. Returns true if one was there to remove — which, at startup,
// is exactly the signal that a previous run did not shut down cleanly.
bool RemoveRule();

// Does the table currently say exactly what InstallRule(namespaces, dnsServer)
// would make it say?
//
// This is what turns "something under the policy table changed" into a decision,
// and it is a comparison rather than an unconditional rewrite for one reason: our
// own write is itself a change to that table. A watcher that reinstalled on every
// notification would notify itself, forever. Reading first converges instead — the
// repair fires a notification, the notification finds the rule already correct, and
// there it stops.
//
// An empty `namespaces` describes a machine with nothing to route, so the state it
// asks about is the rule being absent.
bool RuleMatches(const std::vector<std::string>& namespaces, const std::wstring& dnsServer);

// A standing subscription to the policy table.
//
// The rule is the half of DNS redirection that this program does not hold open: it
// is a registry key, and anything with administrator rights can delete it —
// Remove-DnsClientNrptRule, a Group Policy refresh, a network reset, a registry
// cleaner. When that happens redirection silently stops, and without this nothing
// would notice until someone asked.
//
// The kernel offers the exact event, so no interval has to be invented: the handle
// below is signalled when anything under the policy table changes. It costs nothing
// until then.
//
// THREAD AFFINITY. RegNotifyChangeKeyValue ties the subscription to the thread that
// registers it, and signals the event if that thread exits. REG_NOTIFY_THREAD_AGNOSTIC
// lifts that, but it is Windows 8 and this program targets _WIN32_WINNT=0x0601. So
// Open(), every Rearm() and the wait itself must all run on one thread, and that
// thread must outlive the watch. Redirector's guardian is built to be that thread.
//
// The subscription is one-shot: after the event signals, Rearm() asks for the next
// one. Rearm BEFORE reading the table, never after — a subscription taken first
// covers every change from that moment on, so a deletion that lands while the rule
// is being read still wakes the next wait. The other order has a gap exactly the
// width of the read, and what falls into it is never noticed at all.

    RuleWatch() = default;

    // Ask for the next notification, after the event has signalled. If the table was
    // deleted outright — which invalidates the open key and makes every later
    // subscription on it fail — it is reopened and the subscription taken on the new
    // one.
    bool Rearm();

    // Signalled when the policy table has changed. Null until a successful Open().
    //
    // The same handle for this object's whole life: a reopen inside Rearm() replaces
    // the key, never the event. A waiter can therefore put this in a wait array once
    // and keep it there.

// ---- The service that enforces all of the above ------------------------------
//
// The policy table is the DNS Client service's own: it is stored under that
// service's Parameters key and applied by it. If the service is not running, an
// installed rule sits in the registry doing nothing — every listed name resolves
// the ordinary way, the local proxy never sees a connection, and not one thing
// about the failure points at DNS. So the state is checked before anything is
// installed, rather than discovered afterwards by a user whose sites all broke.
//
// Windows ships the service as Automatic and does not allow it to be stopped
// (it reports NOT_STOPPABLE), so the only way it is ever found down is that
// something set its start type to Disabled and the machine was restarted — which
// several widely copied "system tuning" guides tell people to do.
//
// Nothing here tries to repair that, and the reason is not squeamishness. Both
// routes were measured and both are dead ends within a running session:
//   * ChangeServiceConfig cannot be reached at all. Dnscache's security descriptor
//     denies SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG even to an administrator, and OpenService fails
//     outright when that right is requested.
//   * Writing the start type straight into the registry succeeds, but the service
//     control manager caches the configuration it read at boot, so StartService
//     still refuses with ERROR_SERVICE_DISABLED afterwards.
// Either way the machine has to be restarted, so the honest thing to offer is the
// instruction to restart it — not code that changes service configuration and then
// asks for a restart anyway.

    Unavailable,  // the service manager could not be asked
