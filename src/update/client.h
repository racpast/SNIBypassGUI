// message selection, two evaluations of the same pair of operands with nothing
// keeping them in agreement.
//
// The distinction is not cosmetic. The executable-update decision is INEQUALITY, not
// "greater than": a force-aligned channel must be able to move clients DOWN as well
// as up, so Downgrade means "update, in that direction", not "refuse".
