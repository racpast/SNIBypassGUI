    truncation of a long list are the client's, decided once per language. A string
    carries its own list syntax and every future marker would otherwise become a
    client change.

    A legacy string is split on newlines and a leading "• ", "- " or "* " is
    stripped, so entries written under the old convention — including the ones
    already deployed, which are never rewritten — arrive as the items they meant.

    Module-level rather than nested inside the loader because `--notes-en` and
    `--notes-zh` are the other way notes reach the manifest, and a publish that used
    one of those would otherwise write a bare string into a field the client reads as
