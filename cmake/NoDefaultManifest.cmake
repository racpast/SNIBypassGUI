# Derive a GCC spec override that suppresses the automatic default-manifest.o.
#
# app.rc embeds our own RT_MANIFEST requesting administrator rights. GCC links its
# own default-manifest.o (asInvoker) into every non-DLL, causing a linker failure
# with ".rsrc merge failure: multiple non-default manifests".
#
# The override is generated from the compiler's `-dumpspecs` output by deleting the
# default-manifest.o entry from the *endfile block. This ensures it stays correct
# across compiler updates.
#
# Sets SNIB_NO_DEFAULT_MANIFEST_SPEC to the generated file's path.
